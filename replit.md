# Overview

This is a Minecraft bot project built with Node.js that creates an automated player using the Mineflayer library. The bot connects to a Minecraft server and performs automated actions including periodic movement and chat commands to maintain an active presence on the server. The bot is designed to simulate player activity through configurable movement patterns and chat interactions.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Core Bot Framework
The application uses a class-based architecture centered around the `MinecraftBot` class, which manages the bot's lifecycle and behavior. The bot leverages the Mineflayer library as the primary interface to interact with Minecraft servers, providing protocol-level communication and game state management.

## Configuration Management
The system uses a centralized configuration approach through a dedicated `config.js` module that manages:
- Server connection parameters (host, port, username, version)
- Movement behavior settings (intervals and duration)
- Chat command configurations and timing

Environment variables are supported for runtime configuration, with sensible defaults provided for development scenarios.

## Automated Behavior System
The bot implements two primary automated behaviors:
- **Movement System**: Periodic random movement to simulate active player presence
- **Chat System**: Automated execution of server commands on configurable intervals

Both systems use JavaScript intervals for timing control and include proper cleanup mechanisms.

## Event-Driven Architecture
The bot uses an event-driven pattern built on top of Mineflayer's event system, responding to server events like spawning, chat messages, and connection states. This allows for reactive behavior and proper state management throughout the bot's lifecycle.

## Error Handling and Logging
The application implements console-based logging with emoji indicators for different event types and error states. Error handling focuses on connection failures and graceful shutdown procedures.
